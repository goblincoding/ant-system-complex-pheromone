Possible Smart Pheromone Implementation
========================================
At each step, ants emit signal with own ID, current node ID and tour length so far. Pheromone has internal array of size "nr of ants", subscribe to signals, 
retrieves weights from ants' nodes to itself and uses ant ID as index on internal array on which to set adapted density. Perhaps adapted density can be
current density * 1/(ant tour length + step distance). Neighbour heuristic will need to be adapted or replaced, when querying heuristic/pheromone density, ant
will provide own ID and will receive adapted value. Check if operator overload on pheromone is worth it, i.e pheromone = value should set density.

Update - pheromone knows what arc it is on (initiate them this way), ants can touch pheromone with current node and notVisited array (i.e. only inform
pheromone that are in the feasible neighbourhood)
